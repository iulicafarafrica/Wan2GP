    "alt_prompt": "A gritty, boom-bap hip-hop track built on a hard-hitting drum loop with vinyl crackle textures and a deep sub-bass foundation. The verses feature an assertive male rapper delivering lyrics in Tagalog over atmospheric synth pads that create a tense mood. The chorus shifts to smooth, layered R&B-style sung vocals for contrast before returning to the rap verse. A prominent turntablism section features scratched vocal samples from the chorus hook 'My people's rise', reinforcing its classic hip-hop roots. The production is direct yet raw, focusing on the powerful lyrical delivery against a dark, urban soundscape.",
